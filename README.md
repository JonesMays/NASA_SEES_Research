Mars ISRU Reconnaissance and Experimentation (MIREX) Mission at Mawrth Vallis by Jones Mays

Introduction:

- Focus: Testing ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization) technologies for Mars.
- Objectives: Assessing habitability, Martian climate/medical concerns, analyzing mineral composition, and searching for past life biosignatures.
  
Landing Site Selection:

- Mawrth Vallis chosen for its resources, potential life signs, and ISRU testing suitability.
- Significant due to water erosion history, clay soil preserving biosignatures, and rich mineral presence.
  
Instrument Selection:

- Instruments chosen for Martian conditions and mission objectives.
- Key instruments: REMS, SuperCam, 3D Printer, Sabatier Reactor.
  
Rover Traverse:

- Detailed plan for rover movement and analysis across multiple sites in Mawrth Vallis.
- Each site selected for specific studies like mineral analysis and searching for biosignatures.
  
Conclusion:

- Mission aims to validate ISRU technologies crucial for future Mars missions.
- Utilizes various instruments for comprehensive exploration and analysis.
